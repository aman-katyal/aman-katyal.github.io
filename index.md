## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate at Purdue University (GPA: 3.99/4.0) with a passion for the intersection of hardware and software. I specialize in designing custom PCBs, architecting embedded firmware, and verifying complex digital logic using UVM.

My goal is to build robust, high-performance computing systems—whether that's underwater robotics, RISC-V SoCs, or low-latency gaming peripherals.
