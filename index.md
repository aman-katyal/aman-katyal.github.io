## Professional Summary
Computer Engineering student at Purdue University (GPA: 3.94/4.0). I specialize in the intersection of hardware architecture and verification, with experience ranging from UVM-based silicon verification to high-speed PCB design for robotic systems.

---

## Silicon Verification & Digital Design
*RTL Design, UVM Verification, and ASIC Physical Design Flow.*

### [RISC-V FPU UVM Verification](/projects/risc-v-verification)
Architected a modular UVM testbench for an AFT x09 SoC FPU using DPI-C golden models and Tcl automation.

### [ASIC Physical Design & Timing Closure](/projects/asic-physical-design)
Guided a digital design through synthesis, CTS, and routing to achieve 400MHz timing closure using Synopsys and Cadence tools.

### [USB 1.1 Full-Speed SoC Peripheral](/projects/usb-peripheral)
Designed a USB transceiver with NRZI encoding and an AHB-Lite interface featuring Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) logic.

### [AHB-Lite FIR Filter Hardware Accelerator](/projects/fir-accelerator)
Developed a 4-tap programmable DSP accelerator with memory-mapped coefficients and hazard handling logic.

---

## Robotics & Embedded Systems
*Hardware design and firmware for underwater and modular robotic platforms.*

### [Unified ROV Control Systems](/projects/rov-systems)
Pioneered a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test bench using RP2350/STM32 to decouple firmware/hardware cycles.
