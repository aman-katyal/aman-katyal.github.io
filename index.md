## 👨‍💻 Professional Summary
[cite_start]Computer Engineering student at Purdue University (GPA: 3.94/4.0)[cite: 1, 3, 5]. [cite_start]I specialize in the intersection of hardware architecture and verification, with experience ranging from UVM-based silicon verification to high-speed PCB design for underwater robotics[cite: 7, 14, 20].

## 🔬 Silicon Verification & Digital Design
*RTL Design, UVM Verification, and ASIC Physical Design Flow.*

### [RISC-V FPU UVM Verification](/projects/risc-v-verification)
[cite_start]Architected a modular UVM testbench for an AFT x09 SoC FPU using DPI-C golden models and Tcl automation[cite: 9, 10, 11].

### [ASIC Physical Design & Timing Closure](/projects/asic-physical-design)
[cite_start]Guided a digital design through synthesis, CTS, and routing to achieve 400MHz timing closure using Synopsys and Cadence tools[cite: 36, 37].

### [USB 1.1 Full-Speed SoC Peripheral](/projects/usb-peripheral)
[cite_start]Designed a USB transceiver with NRZI encoding and an AHB-Lite interface featuring Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) logic[cite: 24, 25].

### [AHB-Lite FIR Filter Hardware Accelerator](/projects/fir-accelerator)
[cite_start]Developed a 4-tap programmable DSP accelerator with memory-mapped coefficients and hazard handling logic[cite: 28, 29].

---

## 🤖 Robotics & Embedded Systems
*Hardware design and firmware for autonomous underwater vehicles.*

### [Swarm-Style AUV Compute Architecture](/projects/auv-electronics)
Architected hierarchical compute systems for AUVs, designing custom carrier boards for Jetson Orin Nano and Pi CM5.

### [Unified ROV Control Systems](/projects/rov-systems)
[cite_start]Pioneered a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test bench using RP2350/STM32 to decouple firmware/hardware cycles[cite: 14, 16].
